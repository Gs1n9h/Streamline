# üß™ Test Plan: General Work Job System

## Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Run the Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- Copy contents of packages/db/sql/08-general-work-job-system.sql
-- Execute the entire script
```

### 2. Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Check that all companies have default jobs
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.name,
  c.default_job_id,
  j.name as default_job_name,
  j.is_system_default
FROM streamline.companies c
LEFT JOIN streamline.jobs j ON c.default_job_id = j.id
WHERE c.default_job_id IS NULL 
   OR j.is_system_default IS NOT TRUE;

-- Should return 0 rows
```

---

## Test Cases

### üîß Database Level Tests

#### Test 1: System Default Job Creation
```sql
-- Test: ensure_company_has_default_job is idempotent
SELECT streamline.ensure_company_has_default_job('your-company-id-here');
-- Run twice, should return same job_id both times

-- Verify job was created
SELECT * FROM streamline.jobs 
WHERE company_id = 'your-company-id-here' AND is_system_default = TRUE;
```

#### Test 2: RLS Policy Protection
```sql
-- Test: Users cannot create system default jobs
INSERT INTO streamline.jobs (name, company_id, is_system_default)
VALUES ('Fake System Job', 'your-company-id-here', TRUE);
-- Should fail with RLS policy violation

-- Test: Cannot delete system default job
DELETE FROM streamline.jobs WHERE is_system_default = TRUE;
-- Should fail or delete 0 rows

-- Test: Cannot archive system default job
UPDATE streamline.jobs 
SET is_archived = TRUE 
WHERE is_system_default = TRUE;
-- Should fail with check constraint violation
```

#### Test 3: Clock-in Function
```sql
-- Test: Clock in without job (job tracking disabled)
SELECT streamline.create_timesheet_with_optional_job(
  'user-id-here',
  'company-id-here',
  NULL,  -- No job provided
  40.7128,  -- Latitude
  -74.0060  -- Longitude
);
-- Should succeed and return timesheet_id

-- Verify timesheet was created with default job
SELECT t.*, j.name as job_name, j.is_system_default
FROM streamline.timesheets t
JOIN streamline.jobs j ON t.job_id = j.id
WHERE t.staff_id = 'user-id-here'
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Migration Failed
**Symptoms:** Error messages during SQL execution
**Solution:** 
1. Check for syntax errors in SQL
2. Verify schema exists
3. Check for conflicting policies
4. Run rollback script if needed

### Issue: Clock-in Still Fails
**Symptoms:** NULL job_id constraint violation
**Solution:**
1. Verify company has default job: `SELECT default_job_id FROM streamline.companies WHERE id = 'company-id'`
2. Check if default job exists: `SELECT * FROM streamline.jobs WHERE id = 'default-job-id'`
3. Run ensure function manually: `SELECT streamline.ensure_company_has_default_job('company-id')`

### Issue: System Default Not Protected
**Symptoms:** Can delete system default job
**Solution:**
1. Check RLS policies are active: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'jobs'`
2. Verify user context: `SELECT auth.uid()`
3. Re-run RLS policy creation

### Issue: Performance Problems
**Symptoms:** Slow queries or timeouts
**Solution:**
1. Check indexes: `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'jobs'`
2. Analyze query plans: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...`
3. Verify statistics are up to date: `ANALYZE streamline.jobs`

## Monitoring Queries

### Check System Health
```sql
-- Companies without default jobs (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) as companies_without_defaults
FROM streamline.companies c
LEFT JOIN streamline.jobs j ON c.default_job_id = j.id
WHERE c.default_job_id IS NULL OR j.is_system_default IS NOT TRUE;

-- System default jobs per company (should be 1 each)
SELECT 
  company_id,
  COUNT(*) as system_defaults_count
FROM streamline.jobs 
WHERE is_system_default = TRUE 
GROUP BY company_id
HAVING COUNT(*) != 1;

-- Recent clock-ins using system defaults
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as recent_system_default_clockins
FROM streamline.timesheets t
JOIN streamline.jobs j ON t.job_id = j.id
WHERE j.is_system_default = TRUE
  AND t.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Average clock-in function execution time
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  funcname,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time
FROM pg_stat_user_functions 
WHERE funcname LIKE '%timesheet%';
```
