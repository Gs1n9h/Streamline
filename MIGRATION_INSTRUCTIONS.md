# ðŸš€ Employee Invitations Migration Instructions

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **403 Forbidden Error** - Fixed by removing admin API calls and fetching email from profiles table
2. **Missing Pending Invitations** - Created complete employee_invitations system with filtering

## Required Migration

To enable the employee invitations feature, you need to run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard:

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Run the Migration
Copy and paste the contents of `packages/db/sql/07-employee-invitations.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

**OR**

Copy and paste this SQL directly:

```sql
-- ========= EMPLOYEE INVITATIONS SYSTEM =========
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS streamline.employee_invitations (
  id            UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  company_id    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES streamline.companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email         TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name     TEXT NOT NULL,
  role          TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'staff')),
  pay_rate      NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
  pay_period    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'hourly' CHECK (pay_period IN ('hourly')),
  status        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'expired', 'cancelled')),
  token         UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  invited_by    UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES streamline.profiles(id),
  invited_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT (NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'),
  accepted_at   TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employee_invitations_company_id ON streamline.employee_invitations (company_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employee_invitations_email ON streamline.employee_invitations (email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employee_invitations_status ON streamline.employee_invitations (status);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_employee_invitations_unique_pending 
ON streamline.employee_invitations (company_id, email) 
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE streamline.employee_invitations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view invitations for their companies" ON streamline.employee_invitations
  FOR SELECT USING (
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id 
      FROM streamline.company_members 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage invitations for their companies" ON streamline.employee_invitations
  FOR ALL USING (
    company_id IN (
      SELECT company_id 
      FROM streamline.company_members 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration
After running the migration, you should see:
- âœ… `employee_invitations` table created in the `streamline` schema
- âœ… All indexes and policies applied
- âœ… No errors in the SQL Editor
